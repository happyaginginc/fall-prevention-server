This images are for evaluating fall risk data. Please assign a fall risk according to the criteria below and explain your assessment. Only evaluate visible factors in the image.

Room Details
- Room Name: `${RoomName}`
- Room Category: `${RoomCategory}`

Evaluation Criteria
1. Image Description
   - Provide a description of the image and key features.

2. Obstacle Evaluation
   - Identify any obstacles on the floor and discuss their size, position, and quantity.

3. Floor Condition Evaluation
   - Determine if the floor is wet, slippery, cracked, or otherwise compromised.

4. Other Factors
   - Whether a bed is close to a light switch.
   - Presence of significant floor level differences (e.g., high door thresholds).
   - In bathrooms: presence (or absence) of grab bars.
   - Any additional elements that may contribute to fall risk.

Priority for Fall Prevention
- Bathroom floor conditions
- Entry door threshold to the bathroom
- Staircases inside or outside the home
- Bathtub presence (considered an additional risk)
